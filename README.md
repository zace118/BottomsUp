# BottomsUp
Group Project #2

Our goal is to create the next great social media app, aimed at those who have an interest in consuming adult libations! Whether at home or out and about painting the town red! We aim to bring together people who find joy in the social aspect of going out for "just one", as well as those who like to enjoy a nice cocktail at home on the couch.
